# Good Search

`Good Search` is a lightweight extension that enhances your buying experience.

## How can `Good Search`  improve my shopping?

Some shops want you to open up every single product before checking what's the deal.

To save your time and money, `Good Search` shows essential information about the items directly on the search page.
It also allows you to quickly filter your preferred stuff through your criteria.

## Why only Banggood?

Currently, we support Banggood. But more shops will be handled in the next future, no worries!
